🕵️‍♂️ Spot the Scam
Detecting fraudulent job listings using machine learning and visual insights.

📌 Project Overview
Online job boards are being increasingly misused by scammers to post fake job listings. These scams not only waste the time of job seekers but can also lead to financial and personal information loss.

This project aims to identify such fake listings using a machine learning model and deliver insights via an interactive dashboard.

🚀 Key Features
Upload a CSV file with job listing data.

Predict whether each job is fraudulent or real.

Show probability of fraud per listing.

Dashboard displays:

Table of predictions

Histogram of fraud probabilities

Pie chart of real vs fake jobs

Top-10 most suspicious jobs

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Google Colab (model training)

Libraries:

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

joblib

Streamlit (optional for dashboard)

SHAP (optional for explainability)
